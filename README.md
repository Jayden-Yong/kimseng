**About Our Website**

This website was developed by a group of Year 1 Computer Science students from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Malaya. Each student is pursuing a different major within the Bachelor of Computer Science program.

Our website aims to tackle a common problem faced by students in the Klang Valley: expensive delivery fees. To address this, we've designed a platform where restaurateurs can promote their businesses and operate more effectively online. We offer both delivery and pickup services, and encourage environmentally-friendly practices by offering discounts to customers who choose not to use disposable cutlery.
